# Useful OS X Services for Coders

This is a collection of useful OS X services I use when coding:

* Markdown -- Converts selected text in any application to Markdown syntax, copies it to the clipboard, then opens up the preview inside a browser
* New Private Gist -- Publishes selected text in any application to [gist.github](https://gist.github.com) as a private gist
* New Public Gist -- Publishes selected text in any application to [gist.github](https://gist.github.com) as a public gist

Got your own? Fork this and add yours in.
